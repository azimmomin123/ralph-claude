## 2026-01-22 - US-001: Verify/Create Database

**What was implemented:**
- Verified PostgreSQL database `sellerhub-dashboard-v1` exists and is accessible
- Created docker-compose.yml file for containerized PostgreSQL setup (as per CLAUDE.md spec)
- Confirmed database connection works via Python psycopg2 library

**Files changed:**
- docker-compose.yml (created)

**Database verification results:**
- Connected to database: sellerhub-dashboard-v1
- PostgreSQL version: 16.11
- Query execution: successful

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- The development machine has PostgreSQL running locally (not in Docker), accessible as `azimmomin` user
- psql and docker CLI tools are not available in this environment, but Python psycopg2 works for database operations
- The backend/app directory is empty - Python files need to be created in subsequent stories
- mypy is available in the venv for typechecking
